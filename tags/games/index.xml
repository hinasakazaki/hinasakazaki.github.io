      <description>This past June, I had the unique experience of publishing a bite-sized representation of what I had been working on for a little under a year and a half to the world:
 Google AI Blog Post: Quickly Training Game-Playing Agents with Machine Learning Falken Github Repository  One and a half years seems like a really short time, and most of it was spent during quarantine.
During that time I started driving for real (I had a license for license sake for 10+ years), purchased a home, moved, and handled more than a couple family changes, including welcoming a cat.</description>

      <description>üí™Swole Squadü•äüêúü•ó is a game I submitted for the LD48 game jam back in April.
Play at: https://hinerz.itch.io/swole-squad or http://hinasakazaki.com/ChatHorror/
GitHub: https://github.com/hinasakazaki/ChatHorror
Overview Inspired by some story-telling chat apps, I decided that for this Ludum Dare, I would make a chat based novel game.
Rather than aesthetics or technology, I tried to focus on the emotions text and sound can trigger.
A chat screen is something we&amp;rsquo;re used to seeing &amp;ndash; the more realistic it is, the easier it is for the player to immerse as the recipient of the messages, and someone making choices on what messages to send.</description>

First, a .gif to start off things&amp;hellip; In the midst of shelter-in-home, I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching a reality show called Love is Blind like many other consumers. In addition to that, I&amp;rsquo;ve been watching &amp;ldquo;Couples Therapist Reacts to Love is Blind&amp;rdquo; on YouTube and it&amp;rsquo;s been surprisingly insightful! link here
Having been shut in with my spouse for over a month now, I am increasingly thankful for vulnerable moments, and aware of walls that we put up when we are unhappy.</description>

      <description>I made a game called Every Day The Game for my now fiance.
Note that the rest of the post is a direct copy of what is on my github project README.

Concept May or June of 2014, we celebrated our first year anniversary at a paint-your-stuff place and I painted this.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of it as a game idea, but a cutesy little design.</description>

      <description>In December, I worked on a game called My (Magical) Best Friend! which is a visual novel inspired by anime (especially Madoka). It turns out that a youtuber made a Let&amp;rsquo;s Play Video of it.
It&amp;rsquo;s really great to see your game be played by someone who you don&amp;rsquo;t know, who plays games for the sake of playing games (unlike other Ludum Dares where people play your games so they can get votes as well.</description>

      <title>You are the monster: Labor Day</title>

      <description>Ludum Dare 33&amp;rsquo;s theme was &amp;ldquo;You are the Monster&amp;rdquo;.
With a theme like ‚ÄúYou are the Monster‚Äù, and Labor Day in mind (I‚Äôm already excited for my 3 day weekend) I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but to remember recent controversies with Amazon‚Äì shedding light also to the warehouse worker conditions.
I don‚Äôt want to be too literal or heavyhanded. My goal is to make a small, cute game that has some satirical quality.</description>

      <description>Hello!
I am currently finishing up a game called Slinging Ink.
You can play online multiplayer on the link.
Currently, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a tutorial level, so I thought to explain it here.
Thus begins our &amp;ldquo;How to Play&amp;rdquo;:
1) The main screen has three buttons, &amp;ldquo;Find Match&amp;rdquo; for going into matchmaking system and finding an opponent to play with. You might have to wait a bit for the opponent to get ready, so only do this if you have time.</description>

      <description>This is going to be a quick one. In our Art 178 class we made a &amp;ldquo;quick loop&amp;rdquo; game. My quick loop was the following: boyfriend says he wants something &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; player works, makes money, buys it for him &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; boyfriend is happy and gives love
Yes, super strange and reductionalist. Oh well!
Eventually I added more features to the game by adding win/lose conditions:
 Win love by money</description>
