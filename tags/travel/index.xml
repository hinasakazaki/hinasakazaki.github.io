      <description>Inspired by my friend&amp;rsquo;s travel blog, I&amp;rsquo;m determined to record my experience going on a cruise with my spouse and my parents-in-law. The cruise was with Viking Cruises and it was called Mediterranean Odyssey. It was just under $8k per person, and our first all-inclusive trip experience.
We didn&amp;rsquo;t really take much vacation during the pandemic &amp;ndash; a small trip to Napa in Summer 2022 served as a mini vacation but the others were mostly going here and there for weddings or family stuff.</description>

      <description>After two years and ten months, my last day at Zynga was April 13th.
Before starting my new job at Google I decided to take a super short weekend trip to Seattle to visit my younger sister who is doing her PhD at University of Washington.
It was super rainy, but still lots of fun. The highlights were H-Mart, the Link Light Rail transportation system, the Duke Ellington Orchestra at the Seattle Symphony, the Japanese Baptist Church, the Seattle Japanese Garden, and the UDub campus.</description>
