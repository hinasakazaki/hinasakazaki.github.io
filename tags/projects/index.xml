      <title>The Journey to my Signature Soap Recipe</title>

      <description>I started soaping for the following reasons:
 We had old oil we used for frying that we failed to take to the recycling center during our move in 2017. We had a gallon of old canola oil that one of my old roommates left between 2014 and 2015. My spouse eats a lot of bacon due to his keto diet.  My mom had told me before that my grandma would make something called 廃油石鹸, which in English means &amp;ldquo;Waste oil soap&amp;rdquo; back in the day with old frying oil.</description>

      <title>Summer 2019 Hair Expedition</title>

      <description>Like a typical femme-person-about-to-get-married, I grew my hair out for the wedding. The 20 inches of thick, healthy hair performed well on our big day, and by that time, I was so sick of having the same hair. Historically I had done all sorts of stuff (color, ombre, side-buzz…), and finally, I could unleash my creativity and apply the scientific method on this long, substantive canvas once again.
I used to get my hair bleached and colored at a salon in Berkeley.</description>

      <description>I had a great 2 years and 10 months of incredible learning and fun at Zynga, but in November 2017, I decided that it was a good time to look for a new opportunity.
I started my new job at Google in April 2018, and now that I&amp;rsquo;ve been at my new workplace for 6 months, I&amp;rsquo;d like to talk about my strategy and advice for switching jobs a few years out of college.</description>

      <description>I got sick of my old handmade frontend design, Django backend, so I decided to use Hugo to make my static website. I used the hugo-geo template. It was super easy and quick, and so much prettier. I highly recommend it!
Some screenshots of my old website:
I did enjoy the thumbnails for my projects, so I can see if I can do that here, too, itch.io style.</description>

      <description>I made a game called Every Day The Game for my now fiance.
Note that the rest of the post is a direct copy of what is on my github project README.
Play Download at Itch.io
Watch PlayThrough Video on YouTube
Concept May or June of 2014, we celebrated our first year anniversary at a paint-your-stuff place and I painted this.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t think of it as a game idea, but a cutesy little design.</description>

      <description>In December, I worked on a game called My (Magical) Best Friend! which is a visual novel inspired by anime (especially Madoka). It turns out that a youtuber made a Let&amp;rsquo;s Play Video of it.
It&amp;rsquo;s really great to see your game be played by someone who you don&amp;rsquo;t know, who plays games for the sake of playing games (unlike other Ludum Dares where people play your games so they can get votes as well.</description>

      <title>You are the monster: Labor Day</title>

      <description>Ludum Dare 33&amp;rsquo;s theme was &amp;ldquo;You are the Monster&amp;rdquo;.
With a theme like “You are the Monster”, and Labor Day in mind (I’m already excited for my 3 day weekend) I couldn&amp;rsquo;t help but to remember recent controversies with Amazon– shedding light also to the warehouse worker conditions.
I don’t want to be too literal or heavyhanded. My goal is to make a small, cute game that has some satirical quality.</description>

      <description>Hello!
I am currently finishing up a game called Slinging Ink.
You can play online multiplayer on the link.
Currently, we don&amp;rsquo;t have a tutorial level, so I thought to explain it here.
Thus begins our &amp;ldquo;How to Play&amp;rdquo;:
1) The main screen has three buttons, &amp;ldquo;Find Match&amp;rdquo; for going into matchmaking system and finding an opponent to play with. You might have to wait a bit for the opponent to get ready, so only do this if you have time.</description>

      <title>Game of Love and Money</title>

      <description>This is going to be a quick one. In our Art 178 class we made a &amp;ldquo;quick loop&amp;rdquo; game. My quick loop was the following: boyfriend says he wants something &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; player works, makes money, buys it for him &amp;ndash;&amp;gt; boyfriend is happy and gives love
Yes, super strange and reductionalist. Oh well!
Eventually I added more features to the game by adding win/lose conditions:
 Win love by money</description>
